# bigecyhmm: Biogeochemical cycle HMMs search

This is a package to search for genes associated with biogeochemical cycles in protein sequence fasta files. The HMMs come from METABOLIC article, KEGG, PFAM, TIGR.

## Dependencies

bigecyhmm is developed to be as minimalist as possible. It requires:

- [PyHMMER](https://github.com/althonos/pyhmmer): to perform HMM search.
- [Pillow](https://github.com/python-pillow/Pillow): to create biogeochemical cycle diagrams.

The HMMs used are stored inside the package as a zip file ([hmm_files.zip](https://github.com/ArnaudBelcour/bigecyhmm/tree/main/bigecyhmm/hmm_databases)). It makes this python package a little heavy (around 15 Mb) but in this way, you do not have to download other files and can directly use it.

## Installation

It can be installed from PyPI:

`pip install bigecyhmm`

Or it can be installed with pip by cloning the repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/ArnaudBelcour/bigecyhmm.git

cd bigecyhmm

pip install -e .

```

## Run bigecyhmm

You can used the tools with two calls:

- by giving as input a protein fasta file:

```sh
bigecyhmm -i protein_sequence.faa -o output_dir
```

- by giving as input a folder containing multiple fasta files:

```sh
bigecyhmm -i protein_sequences_folder -o output_dir
```

There is one option:

* `-c` to indicate the number of core used. It is only useful if you have multiple protein fasta files as the added cores will be used to run another HMM search on a different protein fasta files. 

## Output of bigecyhmm

It gives as output:

- a folder `hmm_results`: one tsv files showing the hits for each protein fasta file.
- `function_presence.tsv` a tsv file showing the presence/absence of generic functions associated with the HMMs that matched.
- a folder `diagram_input`, the necessary input to create Carbon, Nitrogen, Sulfur and other cycles with the [R script](https://github.com/ArnaudBelcour/bigecyhmm/blob/main/scripts/draw_biogeochemical_cycles.R) modified from the [METABOLIC repository](https://github.com/AnantharamanLab/METABOLIC) using the following command: `Rscript draw_biogeochemical_cycles.R bigecyhmm_output_folder/diagram_input_folder/ diagram_output TRUE`. This script requires the diagram package that could be installed in R with `install.packages('diagram')`.
- a folder `diagram_figures` contains biogeochemical diagram figures drawn from template situated in `bigecyhmm/templates`.
- `bigecyhmm.log`: log file.
- `bigecyhmm_metadata.json`: bigecyhmm metadata (Python version used, package version used).
- `function_presence.tsv`: occurrence of the functions in the different input protein files.
- `pathway_presence.tsv`: occurrence of the major metabolic pathways in the different inputs files.
- `pathway_presence_hmms.tsv`: HMMs with matches for the major metabolic pathways in the different inputs files.
- `Total.R_input.txt`: ratio of the occurrence of major metabolic pathways in the all communities.

## bigecyhmm_visualisation

There is a second command associated with bigecyhmm (`bigecyhmm_visualisation`), to create visualisation of the results.

To create the associated figures, there are other dependencies:

- pandas
- seaborn
- plotly
- kaleido

Two subcommands are available for `bigecyhmm_visualisation`:

- `bigecyhmm_visualisation esmecata`: to create visualisation from EsMeCaTa and bigecyhmm outputs folder (with optionally an abundance file).
- `bigecyhmm_visualisation genomes`: to create visualisation from bigecyhmm output folder (with optionally an abundance file).

There are four parameters:

- `--esmecata`: EsMeCaTa output folder associated with the run (as the visualisation works on esmecata results). Only required for `bigecyhmm_visualisation esmecata`.
- `--bigecyhmm`: bigecyhmm output folder associated with the run. Required for both `bigecyhmm_visualisation esmecata` and `bigecyhmm_visualisation genomes`.
- `--abundance-file`: abundance file indicating the abundance for each organisms selected by EsMeCaTa. Optional for both `bigecyhmm_visualisation esmecata` and `bigecyhmm_visualisation genomes`.
- `-o`: an output folder. Required for both `bigecyhmm_visualisation esmecata` and `bigecyhmm_visualisation genomes`.

### Function occurrence and abundance

For visualisation, two values are used to represent the functions.
First, the **occurrence** corresponding to the number of organisms having this function dividing by the total number of organisms in the community. If you give an `abundance file`, a second value is used, the **abundance** (computed for each sample in the abundance file). The abundance of a function is the sum of the abundance of organisms having it divided by the sum of abundance of all organisms in the sample.

For example, if we look at the function `Formate oxidation fdoG` in a community. If 20 organisms in this community have this function on a community having a total of 80 organisms, the **occurrence** of this function is 0.25 (20 / 80). Then, let's say that these 20 organisms have a summed abundance of 600 and the total abundance of all organisms in the community is 1200, then the **abundance** of the function is 0.5 (600 / 1200).

### Output of bigecyhmm_visualisation

Several output are created by bigecyhmm_visualisation.

`function_abundance` is a folder containing all visualisation associated with abundance values. It contains:

- `cycle_diagrams_abundance`: a folder containing 4 cycle diagrams (carbon, sulfur, nitrogen and other) from METABOLIC per sample from the abundance file. For each sample, it gives the abundance and the relative abundance of the major function.
- `function_participation`: a folder containing one tabulated file per sample from the abundance file. For each sample, it gives the function abundance associated with each organism in the community.
- `cycle_participation`: a folder containing one tabulated file per sample from the abundance file. For each sample, it gives the cycle abundance associated with each organism in the community.
- `barplot_esmecata_found_taxon_sample.png`: a barplot displaying the coverage of EsMeCaTa according to the abundances from samples. Each bar corresponds to a sample, the y-axis shows the relative abundances of the organisms in the sample. The color indicates which taxonomic rank has been used by EsMeCaTa to predict the consensus proteomes. If EsMeCaTa was not able to predict a consensus proteomes, it is displayed in category `Not found`. With this figure, you can have an idea if there is enough predictions for the different samples in the dataset and at which taxonomic ranks these predictiosn have been made. Thus allowing the estimation of the quality of the predictions: predictions are better if they are closer to lower taxonomic ranks (genus family). 
- `function_abundance_sample.tsv`: a tabulated file containing the ratio of abundance of each function in the different sample. Rows correspond to the functions and columns correspond to the samples. It is used to create the `heatmap_abundance_samples.png` file.
- `heatmap_abundance_samples.png`: a heatmap showing the abundance for all the HMMs searched by bigecyhmm in the different samples.
- `cycle_abundance_sample.tsv`: a tabulated file showing the abundance of major functions in biogeochemical cycles. Rows correspond to the major functions and columns correspond to the samples.
- `polar_plot_abundance_samples.png`: a polar plot showing the abundance of major functions in the samples.

`function_occurrence` is a folder containing all visualisation associated with occurrence values. It contains:

- `cycle_occurence.tsv`: a tabulated file showing the occurrence of major functions in biogeochemical cycles. Rows correspond to the major function and the column corresponds to the community.
- `diagram_*.png`: diagram representing a biogeochemical cycles (carbon, nitrogen, sulfur, other) from METABOLIC. It shows the number of organisms with predicted major functions and the relative occurrence of these functions.
- `function_occurrence.tsv`: a tabulated file containing the ratio for each function. Rows correspond to the function and the column corresponds to the community. It is used to create the `heatmap_occurrence.png` file.
- `heatmap_occurrence.png`: a heatmap showing the occurrence for all the HMMs searched by bigecyhmm in the community (all the input protein files).
- `polar_plot_occurrence.png`: a polar plot showing the occurrence of major functions in the samples.
- `swarmplot_function_ratio_community.png`: a swarmplot showing the occurrence of major functions in the samples.

`bigecyhmm_visualisation.log` is a log file.

`bigecyhmm_visualisation_metadata.json` is a metadata file giving information on the version of the package used.
